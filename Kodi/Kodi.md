## Overview

I've been using [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) as a media platform since 2012, when it was still called `XBMC`. It's always had a great open-source community around it, and I cut my code-writing teeth pasting Python blocks together in search of custom functionality. Below is a non-comprehensive collection of tips I've learned along the way.

## Skins

### Overview

Finding the right skin can make or break one's [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) experience. I played around with upwards of a dozen options when I first started, then settled on the Aeon family, and haven't looked back. To complicate matters, [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) releases a new major version roughly annually, and skins may lose support between versions. 
[Aeon Nox](https://kodi.tv/addon/skins/aeon-nox) was my favorite up until [Kodi Leia](https://kodi.tv/article/kodi-leia-183-release) came out, at which point I switched to [Aeon MQ8](https://kodi.tv/addon/skins/aeon-mq-8), which boasts a similar look and feel.  

### [Aeon MQ8](https://kodi.tv/addon/skins/aeon-mq-8)

#### Description

Simple, modern, lightweight, fairly customizable.

#### Music Visualization Tweak

##### Description

One of my major complaints with [Aeon MQ8](https://kodi.tv/addon/skins/aeon-mq-8) is that the stock overlay for audio playback is way too busy, and detracts from [projectM](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm) visualizations. I use the below config file 

##### File Location

`.kodi/addons/skin.aeonmq8/xml/`

##### `MusicVisualization.xml`

### [Aeon Nox](https://kodi.tv/addon/skins/aeon-nox)

### Description

My favorite skin for the vast majority of my Kodi career. It's starting to lack support so I had to move on, but it'll always have its place in my heart. It's the most customizable skin I've ever come across, yet manages to always look great no matter what tweaks you make.
