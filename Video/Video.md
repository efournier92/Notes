## Overview

[Video Editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_editing) is a common task users want  Web/to perform; it's also one of the toughest tasks for your [processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) to handle. I find [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) tools to be the most powerful in the area, much as they may be trickier to use. Below, I link out to more info on a few such tools.

## [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)

### Description

[FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) is the coolest and most obscurely-ubiquitous tool I've ever happened upon. It's the engine running behind the vast majority of open-source tools for video editing and encoding. Clever [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) commands can invoke virtually any video editing process. I've compiled more information at the following location.
