## Overview
As a child of the 1990s, my family's first computer, a [Compaq Presario 4504](http://www.elhvb.com/mobokive/archive/compaq/presario/Presario%2045xx/4504/4504quickspecs.html), brought all the wonders of the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) into our home. So began my lifelong love affair with the [Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet), on which I've spent a sickening portion of my life, and to which I've dedicated my careers as a [developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer). Below is are a few topics I've happened to document.

## Firebase

### Description
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is a [Google](https://about.google/) product, which offers a cohesive platform for performing back-end tasks. I use it for the [Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database), [Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth), [File Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage), and [Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting). It makes all of those exceedingly simple, play well with [Angular](https://angular.io/), and can eliminate the need to build a back-end for simple apps. I've documented more information in the following location.

## [Service Workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications#Service_workers)

### Description
[Service Workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications#Service_workers) are [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) files that are cached in the browser to provide extended functionality like [Web Push Notifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Webpush), data synchronization, and much more. They're quickly gaining steam asn an important fixture in the [Web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development) toolbox. I've compiled more information at the following location.
