## Overview

I like to use a clipboard manager in my workflow, to store a history of clipboard values, which I reference when per my convenience. Re fact that most operating systems don't ship this as native functionality still baffles me, but there are plenty of the options on the market. My current preference is `CopyQ`, which is an open-source cross-platform tool, available free for any desktop OS. I like it because it's light, feature rich, and highly customizable. I've also tried other options in the past, which are outlined below.

### Description

My first choice for any operating system.

### Settings

I like to tweak the default settings a bit, particularly to use the [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color palette. My download configuration file, along with an example screenshot, are available below.

## [Ditto](https://ditto-cp.sourceforge.io/)

### Description

A Windows-only extension for clipboard management. It's free and works fine, but isn't very customizable.

## [ClipboardFusion](https://www.clipboardfusion.com/)

### Description

Windows-only, simple, no frills, nothing to write home about.
