## Overview

[IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) are integral tools to a developer's workflow. I'm of the mentality that there's no a one-size-fits-all, but rather different tools for different situations. Below is a listing of some [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) I find useful.

## [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Description

I like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an IDE when working on client-side projects, particularly when using [Angular](https://angular.io/) and similar frameworks. Below are some tips I've learned while using it.

## [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

### Description

I use Visual Studio as my [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for a large corporate [ASP.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/#pivot=aspnet) application I work on. I typically use it in conjunction with [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/), for a more powerful experience.
