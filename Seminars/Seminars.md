## Overview
[Seminars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminar), [keynote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote) events, and [training workshops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_workshop) all come with the territory of being a [software developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer). I like to make of the most of such events, by taking notes throughout. I use this folder as a [repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_repository) for such notes, for my own future reference.
